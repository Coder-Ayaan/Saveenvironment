			<h1>  Water Scarcity
			</h1>
				<p> What is water-
					Water, a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous, liquid, and solid states. It is one of the most plentiful and essential of compounds. A tasteless and odourless liquid at room temperature, it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances.

				<h1> How much Water is left
				</h1>
					<p> The earth has an abundance of water, but unfortunately, only a small percentage (about 0.3 percent), is even usable by humans. The other 99.7 percent is in the oceans, soils, icecaps, and floating in the atmosphere. Still, much of the 0.3 percent that is useable is unattainable.Do you know more than 500 million people go to bed after drinking the dirty water available in lakes and rivers .

					<h1> How will water become a big problem  
					</h1>
					<p> Many of the water systems that keep ecosystems thriving and feed a growing human population have become stressed. Rivers, lakes and aquifers are drying up or becoming too polluted to use. More than half the world's wetlands have disappeared. ... By 2025, two-thirds of the world's population may face water shortages.
