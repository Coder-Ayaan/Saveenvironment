<h1> Lets have a look at the most rare plants
</h1>
<p> 1. <strong>Rafflesia Arnoldii - </strong>
Known to be the world’s largest flower, this plant is one of the rarest one in the world. Rafflesia Arnoldii, also known as the corpse plant, this name was given to this plant because of its foul odour that is similar to decaying flesh. Unlike other flowers, this plant doesn’t have a pleasant smell and you can find this flower in the dense rain-forests of Sumatra, Indonesia, Malaysia and Bengkulu.

	<p><strong>2. Encephalartos Woodii - </strong>
One of the rarest plants in the world is the Encephalartos Woodii which is now conserved and restricted to the botanical garden only where it was transported from Zululand. This plant is found in South Africa and is considered being extinct in the wild with all specimens being clones of the type. Its cycad variety had both male and female plants, but long ago there was no specimen of female plants found. That’s why there is no propagation and the male plant is now conserved.

<p>3.<strong> Nepenthes Tenax - </strong>
One of the weirdest looking plants is the Nepenthes Tenax which is considered one of the rare plants in the world. Having quite a few similarities with the pitcher plant, this plant grows up to a height of 100 cms with the pitcher shaped flower on the top, having a height of 15 cms. This is an extremely rare Australian lowland plant native to northern Queensland. This plant is now a part of the endangered species of the world.

<p><strong>4. Welwitschia</strong>
One of the longest living plants also known as the living fossil plant is again one of the rarest plant species found in Africa. This weird-looking plant has a woody, thick, short and stout trunk. This plant has a very slow growth rate and is believed to live for 1000 to 2000 years on earth.

<p> <strong>5. Pennantia Baylisiana</strong>
Scoring a place in the Guinness book of world records. Pennantia Baylisiana is again an extinct plant of the world which is rare to find means you can’t find it easily. This controversial plant has so many gender crisis, some scientists tried to prove whether it’s a female genesis or a male one. This plant has a slow ageing process means it takes almost 10 full years to get fully mature.</p>

<h1> Why are they crying
</h1>
<p> Despite ongoing deforestation, fires, drought-induced die-offs, and insect outbreaks, the world's tree cover actually increased by 2.24 million square kilometers — an area the size of Texas and Alaska combined — over the past 35 years, finds a paper published in the journal Nature.Since humans started cutting down forests, 46 percent of trees have been felled, according to a 2015 study in the journal Nature. Also the trees getting deforested A recent study, published in Science, finds that the world has lost over one-third of its primary forests (defined by the researchers as those undisturbed by humans for more than 140 years) between 1990 and 2015 to land-use change (eg, to create farms) and tree harvesting for wood.
