<h1> Tree
	</h1>
<ol>
	<li>
		If you have a big enough garden, plant trees, for they can cool your homes considerably.
	</li>
	<li>
		Select appropriate plants to suit your garden and the climatic conditions. Your local nursery or horticultural society can help you.
	</li>
	<li>
If your garden is too small for trees, have plants and creepers instead. Every green plant helps to reduce the carbon dioxide we are letting out into the atmosphere.
</li>
<li>
	Garden plants are better than a lawn for absorbing carbon dioxide. So when you plan your garden, opt for extra space for plants rather than for a lawn.
</li>
<li>
	If your city or garden lacks water for gardening, plant drought-resistant plants like cacti, flowering shrubs, etc.
</li>
<li>
	If you live in an apartment, grow a terrace or balcony garden using potted plants.
</li>
<li>
	Window boxes can be used to grow small flowering plants which also add to the beauty of your apartment. Try and use discarded materials to make your boxes.
